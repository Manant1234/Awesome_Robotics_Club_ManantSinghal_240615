Out of all the projects under Robotics Club, I found the Hexabot interesting as I had more inclination towarrds the mechanics part which I feel would be more applicable on these projects .
Saying that, I also found that out of all the projects I can gain maximum knowledge through this project.
Apart from that for Hexabot, the Mentor is Shivansh and I had already been a mentee under him in the Robodive Camp and he was amazing.
